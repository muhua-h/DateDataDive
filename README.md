Unveiling Hidden Traits: Analyzing Textual Information in Dating App Bios to Infer Religious Beliefs

In this study, we aim to investigate whether textual information found in dating app bios can reveal and infer hidden traits, focusing specifically on religious beliefs as a case study. Dating apps have become a prevalent platform for individuals to present themselves to potential partners, and the language they use in their bios may contain subtle cues about their personal characteristics. We hypothesize that individuals may unconsciously disclose aspects of their religious beliefs through their choice of words, expressions, and topics discussed in their bios.

The findings of this study have implications for understanding how individuals convey personal traits and preferences in online dating contexts. Furthermore, the ability to infer hidden traits such as religious beliefs from textual data could have applications in personalized recommendation systems and sociological research. Additionally, this research raises awareness about the potential implications for privacy protection in the digital age, prompting further examination of ethical considerations surrounding data collection and analysis in online platforms.

## Data 

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles/data) we plan to use consists of a collection of dating-app user profiles, specifically their self-introductions or bio (essays). These text data may contain clues about users' religious beliefs, lifestyle, interests, hobbies, and other personal information.

## Method 

To obtain a thorough understanding of the relationship between users’ religion affiliation and their profile content, we decide to take a triangulation approach: 1) (week 5 & 6) using Supervised Learning (classification) to examine whether we can predict one’s religion using one’s dating profile, 2) (week 3) Using topic modeling to examine what users talk about on their profile and how topics relate to one’s religious belief, 3) (week 9) using Multi-Modal Language Modeling with Image generation to create profile users of extreme characteristics.

For this task, we will use one’s profile content to predict their religion, by examining the following four approaches using several different models (). In the end, we will compare their performance and discuss the implications.

<ins>Topic Modeling </ins>

For this task, we will use Structural Topic Model to extract the topics from selected essays (e.g., About me, On a typical Friday night I am), and investigate what people tend to talk about on their profile. Then, we will examine the relationship between topic proportions and their religious belief. 

<ins>Multi-Modal Language Model</ins>

To investigate the generalizability of large language models (LLMs + multimodal) when applied to real-world data. For this, we have chosen an extreme case for analysis: individuals who are extremely serious about atheism and theism. Our first step involves querying the LLM about the characteristics of individuals who are extremely serious about atheism and theism, respectively. From the LLM, we will obtain two sets of keywords, each containing 10 words that represent the perceived characteristics of these two groups.

Next, we will compare these LLM-generated keywords with the traits observed in real-world data. This step is crucial to assess whether the characteristics generated by the LLM align with those observed in the real world, thereby evaluating the accuracy and reliability of the LLM in understanding and describing such extreme cases.

Finally, for a more visual representation of these traits, we will use the 10 characteristic keywords generated by the LLM, along with 10 keywords extracted from real-world data, to prompt the LLM to generate corresponding images. These images will serve as a visual aid to help us better understand and present the differences in traits between extremely serious atheists and theists.
